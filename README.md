## Description

**Write a paragraph summary of the current status of your project, what you hope to achieve during the intensive, how and why**
I am completely starting from scratch for this intensive. Card digitalizer is going to be a project that allows users to upload their playing cards (pokemon, magic the gathering, etc) and find the values of their collections by matching photographs to a database of card prices. In this intensive I will make the frontend for my teammates matching backend. I am going to use react and code frontend for authentication, as well as write code to sort people's cards by type, price etc. 

## Objective 1: Connect backend to frontend
Connect to the django api from react so I can update the model from a frontend form and get the data I need to display the webpages


**Why do you want to meet this objective? How will it improve your project?** 
It allows me to render real, live database data instead of hardcoding data.


**How will you demonstrate completion of your objective?** 
I will be able to add a test card to the form and be able to see it on the list page

## Objective 2: Create 4 web pages
1. Login
2. Signup
3. Card List 
4. Card add form

**Why do you want to meet this objective? How will it improve your project?** 
I want to meet this objective because these are the main pages that need to exist so that people can view my project. This is also my "skateboard".

**How will you demonstrate completion of your objective?** 
I will demonstate completion through my github commits and having a live link of my pages

## Objective 3: Allow the user to sort and filter the data 
**Why do you want to meet this objective? How will it improve your project?** 
It will make the website more dynamic and add a lot of functionality
